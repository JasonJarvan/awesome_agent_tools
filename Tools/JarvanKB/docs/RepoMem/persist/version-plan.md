## Recipe version history

| Version | Recipe ID | Effective | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | `openspec-superpowers-repomem-sendbox-dashboard` | 2026-05-26 → 2026-05-31 | Bootstrap. Deprecated via Full Rewrite. |
| **v2** | `superpowers-repomem-sendbox-dashboard` | 2026-05-31 → | OpenSpec removed for thin-layer formation. See longterm.md §Recipe v1→v2 Migration. |

## Orchestrator generations

Distinct from recipe version: same recipe can span multiple orchestrator sessions; a generation ends when the session writes an inheritance handoff letter (`docs/sendbox/toOrchestrator/g{N}-handoff.md`) and a new CC session is spawned to inherit.

| Generation | Identity | Active range | EOL reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| g1 | bootstrap-orchestrator | 2026-05-26 → 2026-05-30 | Wrote inheritance `handoff.md` post-Phase-1 doc skeleton; burned in SP-0 closure commit (5c28447) |
| g2 | Claude Opus 4.7 (this session) | 2026-05-30 → 2026-05-31 | Wrote `g3-handoff.md` post-SP-0 done + SP-1 launched; context heavy with R1–R9 调研 + 7 governance patches, prune-via-inheritance preferred over `/compact` |
| g3 | Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) | 2026-05-31 → 2026-06-07 | Wrote `g4-handoff.md` after fanning out 2 SubOrche verticals (ZhihuCrawl + BilibiliCrawl); SP-0/1/2/4a done, SP-3/5a wip; landed UN-015 merge-ownership + RepoMem.merge promotion standard + cookie-PULL decision; prune-via-inheritance |
| g4 | Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) | 2026-06-07 → 2026-06-14 | Wrote `g5-handoff.md` after both crawl verticals converged (SubOrche era ended → flat root→impler); SP-0…SP-5b done, SP-6 in flight; landed no-push-lift + MCP-façade route (`Service/mcp/`) + Codex cross-runtime onboarding (cc-switch) + MiroThinker findings + CodeTeam #3/#4 (codegraph + Lane Tiering) + 48xxx port convention; prune-via-inheritance |
| g5 | TBD by user spawn (see Dashboard g5 row) | 2026-06-14 → | — (active); inherits 6 live implers (SP6/ZhihuClassify/GrillDocs/FutureFeatures/BiliRateLimit/WatcherDeploy) + 1 prepared (AntiCrawlMcp/UN-043). Near-term: SP-6 done → SP-7; then v2 arc (MCP façade → auto-researcher → repo index) + v1.0 OSS split |
| **ReachOrche g1** (SubOrche under root g5) | Claude Code session `7b0495f9-…` | 2026-06-18 → | — (active); user-established reach/content-supply-layer SubOrche. Owns: crawl engines/skills/watchers (zhihu/bili + future platforms), SP-8 web-search router (anysearch-B blueprint), anti-crawl/auth, **UN-043 MCP façade dispatch** (transferred from root, user-ratified). Has its own inheritance chain `toReachOrche/g{N}-handoff.md`. Onboarded + scope-confirmed via `from-reachorche-{boundary-ratified,ack}.md` (burned after this reflection) |

**Reach-layer boundary (user-ratified 2026-06-18).** Two-orchestrator structure: **root g5** retains governance +
ingest/cognition verticals (v1 Hermes ingest, MiroThinker UN-042 = Path A, auto-researcher UN-040) + the
non-reach implers (SP6/GrillDocs/FutureFeatures). **ReachOrche g1** owns the content-supply layer (above) + UN-043
dispatch. **Deconfliction (non-disruptive):** in-flight reach-domain implers (UN-036 zhihu-classify / UN-046
bili-engine-ratelimit / UN-047 watcher-deploy) finish under root and converge; ReachOrche assumes the **domain**
forward. **Seam:** consumers (v1 Hermes, MiroThinker) reach the supply via the UN-043 MCP façade — ReachOrche owns
the supply contract (tool schema + compliance), consumers own integration. Milestone gate: ReachOrche holds
reach-capability milestones (new-platform coverage, SP-8 live, MCP-façade live); root holds the v1–v5 product
milestones.

Naming convention: `g{N}-handoff.md` placed in `docs/sendbox/toOrchestrator/` (same box as inbound letters; new orche replaces predecessor, no parallel box). Letter lifecycle: `burn` after inheritor logs first orche-attributable commit (decision letter / Dashboard archive / new SP brainstorming kickoff).

## Project rename

- **AgentCrawl** (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-31): original scope = Zhihu + Bilibili crawlers
- **JarvanKB** (2026-05-31 → ): scope expanded to crawl + ingester + future knowledge tooling; personal-brand naming for OSS release
- Physical rename `Tools/AgentCrawl/` → `Tools/JarvanKB/` performed in a separate session (tracked as Dashboard UN-005)

## Current phase

- **SP-0 in progress** (2026-05-31): repo skeleton + HarnessStack v2 migration
  - Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-SP-0-jarvankb-skeleton-design.md`
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-SP-0-jarvankb-skeleton.md`
  - Impler handoff: `docs/sendbox/toSP0Impler/handoff.md`
- **Live SP status board** (kanban-like): `docs/Dashboard/index.md` §SP Status Board — single H2A surface for sub-project status, owner agent, phase enter gates

## Capability Milestones (v1 → v5+) — user-facing product axis

> Added 2026-06-18 (user-defined). This is the **user-facing capability axis**, distinct from the SP-N
> **implementation-tracking axis** (`docs/Dashboard/index.md §SP Status Board`). One milestone may span multiple
> SPs; one SP may serve multiple milestones. H2A projection (中文) = `Dashboard §里程碑`. These reframe the SP plan
> by delivered capability; they remove nothing. Net-new SPs below are **draft mapping** — the concrete design is
> brainstormed when the milestone is approached (per the milestone-gating rule), not invented now.

| Milestone | Capability (user words) | Draft realizing SP/UN | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **v1** | Talk to me via **Hermes**; the 知乎/B站 content I drop in chat + my own thoughts in that chat → summarize → save into Obsidian | SP-6 CrawlMdSaver (in flight, the URL+notes→merged-md core) + **net-new "Hermes A2A conversational-ingest" SP** + likely MCP façade (UN-043 — Hermes is another runtime → consume crawl via MCP per the consumption rule). Candidate owner: **ReachOrche** (charter pending) | not started (core deps in flight) |
| **v1.1** | Auto-watch + crawl my 知乎/B站 favorites → save to Obsidian vault | SP-5a + SP-5b watchers (done) + SP-5a v1.2 default-collection auto-classify (UN-036, merged 2026-06-18) + **WatcherDeployImpler (UN-047)** deploy | near-done (gated on user vault root) |
| **v1.2** | Watch + process 知乎/B站 links inside Obsidian **Thino** notes; summarize+save same as v1 | **SP-7 ThinoIngester** (queued; unlocks when SP-6 lands) | queued |
| **v2** | Auto-watch + crawl content from people I **follow** on 知乎/B站; filter to keep valuable info; save | net-new (extends the SP-5x watcher family + a filter stage). **Open (待 brainstorm):** which people (e.g. classify-crawl by B站 following groups); filter design (hard metrics + LLM) | not started |
| **v3** | **Deep research** capability | existing `Skill/research/MiroResearch` — swap internals to **apodex API**, depends on the **local MCP** (UN-043). Ties to MiroThinker Path A (UN-042) | not started (MCP façade is the gate) |
| **v4** | **Memory system** | net-new. Ties to FutureFeaturesImpler (UN-040) repo-index / Mem0 / MemOS research draft | not started |
| **v5+** | **Research-agent long-horizon tasks** | net-new. Ties to FutureFeaturesImpler (UN-040) auto-researcher / goal-driven agent draft | not started |

**Milestone-gating rule (orchestrator standing rule — user 2026-06-18).** On **every task completion**, the
orchestrator checks whether a capability milestone is about to unlock and updates `Dashboard §里程碑`. When a
milestone **unlocks or nears completion**, the orchestrator **hands off an impler to take the user through the
"last mile"** to the delivered capability (the deploy/wire-up/UX/ops glue that turns "the SPs are technically
done" into "the user can use it end-to-end") — distinct from any single SP's technical done. Applies to root and
to each SubOrche for its own vertical's milestone(s). Codified in `CLAUDE.md §3` + `longterm.md §Milestone Gating (v2)`.

## v1.0 OSS release plan

When all v1 sub-projects (SP-0 through SP-7) verified end-to-end:

1. Choose Organization name (candidates: `JarvanKB` / `Jarvan` / `JarvanWorks`) — tracked as Dashboard UN-006
2. Execute fractal split per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-SP-0-jarvankb-skeleton-design.md` §9:
   - `git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter <module>/` per sub-project
   - Inherit `docs/HarnessStack/` into each child
   - Initialize child-repo own `docs/{sendbox,Dashboard,RepoMem/persist}/`
   - Create new GitHub repo under Organization, push
3. Mark monorepo (this repo) as umbrella for HarnessStack template + cross-module integration tests

### Prepared future task — whole-repo extraction (user framing 2026-06-11, by g4)

Distinct from the per-SP fractal above: **extract `awesome_agent_tools/Tools/JarvanKB/` as ONE standalone
repo `JarvanKB`; `awesome_agent_tools` keeps only a LINK (submodule, like its existing `Tools/gstack` /
`Skills/ops-doc-maintainer` / … links).** This is the *coarser, first-level* split — whether it REPLACES the
per-SP fractal (§9) or PRECEDES it (fractal later, inside the standalone repo) is an open question for the
activation brainstorm. Deferred handoff prepared at `docs/sendbox/toRepoSplitImpler/handoff.md` (Dashboard
UN-041). **Activation gated on:** v1 done (SP-6/SP-7 still pending) + Org name (UN-006) + explicit user
go-ahead. Key wrinkle recorded there: all JarvanKB history is on `feat/agentcrawl-bootstrap` (never merged to
main), so `git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter Tools/JarvanKB/` must target that branch; never filter-repo
in place (use a mirror clone); `Tools/gstack` stays untouched; reproduce the `!.claude/` gitignore re-include
in the new root.

## Compatibility / upgrade notes

- HarnessStack recipe upgrades: see `longterm.md` §Full Rewrite Conditions
- ASR strategy (D3 in `pre-openspec-decisions.md`) revised in R5 (2026-05-31): **v1 switched from 通义听悟 to BiliNote + bcut (B站必剪 free cloud ASR)**. D3 marked as superseded but file not deleted (historical trace)
- **Cookie delivery for all crawl consumers = active PULL** (user-ratified 2026-06-02, cross-vertical): consumers fetch SP-1 cookies via `GET /get/:uuid` + client decrypt (or `cookie-manager show domain=<x>`); the **SP-1 _push_ delivery path is permanently cancelled** (SP-1 hook engine retained but latent — a future non-decrypting consumer is a config entry, not new code). Relayed by ZhihuCrawl SubOrche; applies to SP-3/SP-5a now + **propagate to SP-4b/5b scope** when their handoffs are written. Detail: `architecture/credentials.md` §Integration contract.
- **Remote push of the feature branch is now ENABLED** (user decision 2026-06-10, by g4): the prior g1–g4 "local commits only — no push" invariant (g3-handoff §6/§8) is **lifted for `feat/agentcrawl-bootstrap` → `origin` only**. The branch was first published 2026-06-10 to the **PUBLIC** repo `github.com/JasonJarvan/awesome_agent_tools` (git root = `awesome_agent_tools`, JarvanKB is `Tools/JarvanKB/`); upstream tracking set. **Still NOT authorized without explicit user say-so:** merge/PR into `main`, history rewrite/rebase, touching the `Tools/gstack` submodule. Public-repo reminder: pushed content is world-visible/indexable — keep real secrets gitignored (`.mcp.json` is untracked; verified no real tokens in tracked files at first push).

## Shared LLM layer (LLMClient) — v1 landed (SP-3), LLMService v2 roadmap

- **v1 (landed 2026-06-07, SP-3):** `Engine/common` packaged as `jarvankb-common`; `LLMClient` real litellm
  body (`from jarvankb_common import LLMClient`). In-process **library**; single repo-root `config/llm.yaml`
  (profiles + `active` fallthrough; literal `api_base` for custom OpenAI-compatible providers, verified live
  with `mimo-v2.5-pro`). Consumers SP-4b/SP-6/SP-7 **reuse — do not reimplement**. Detail:
  `memory/llm-shared-layer.md` + `Engine/common/docs/interface.md`.
- **v2 (roadmap — new platform-level SP, decide with root/SubOrche):** promote LLMClient into a standalone
  `Service/.../llm-service` (HTTP, OpenAI-compatible) for runtime-central config / metering / rate-limit /
  cache / one endpoint / language-agnostic access, with per-consumer provider selection. **Non-breaking:**
  the `LLMClient` interface is frozen, so the swap (litellm-in-process → service call) leaves consumer call
  sites unchanged. (User decision 2026-06-05 "不扩": keep v1 a library; defer the service to v2.)
- **Tiered model router (design aligning with user 2026-06-18; deferred impl = Dashboard UN-050).** Replace
  per-task ad-hoc model choice with a **tier** abstraction so cost scales with task difficulty (cheap model for
  simple tasks like vague-path classification, strong model for hard tasks like long-transcript summarization):
  - **Three tiers** `heavy | medium | light`, each → `{provider, model}`. Today: heavy = `mimo-v2.5-pro`,
    medium = light = `mimo-v2.5` (medium/light alias the same model until distinct mid/light models exist).
  - **`customer` = a service/skill** (zhihu-skill, bili-skill, zhihu-watcher, bili-watcher, crawl-md-saver, …).
    Binding is **customer-first**: each customer declares its default tier (one line) — NOT tier→customer-lists
    (which inverts the runtime lookup and forbids a customer spanning tiers). Unlisted customer → a `default` tier.
  - **Forward-compat — intra-customer per-task routing (deferred):** a customer value may be either a tier string
    (simple) OR `{default: <tier>, tasks: {<task>: <tier>}}`, so sub-tasks inside one customer pick different
    tiers. The `LLMClient` call gains an optional `tier=`/`task=` override; the no-arg call resolves the customer
    default, so the **frozen `LLMClient` interface stays non-breaking** (router = a policy layer behind it).
  - **Schema sketch:** `tiers:` (tier→provider+model — the only place model ids live) + `providers:` (endpoint +
    `api_key_env`, today's profiles minus the model) + `customers:` (customer→tier). Supersedes the current
    `profiles`/`active` block; `active` fallthrough becomes a per-tier or global fallback list.
  - **Professional-router research done** (subagent, 2026-06-18; full report
    `persist/memory/llm-router-research-2026-06-18.md`): **recommendation = roll a thin custom tier-map over
    litellm now** (the tier-map is a config artifact, not a routing engine), keep litellm `Router`/proxy as the
    LB+fallback engine and the v2 `LLMService` target, and **defer dedicated routers (RouteLLM binary /
    semantic-router) to the later intra-customer learned/semantic phase** (`tier="auto"`), plugged behind the same
    frozen seam. Hosted routers (NotDiamond/Martian/OpenRouter-as-router) rejected (external hop / vendor lock).
    **Activation** = v2 LLMService work or explicit user go; capture the final policy in `architecture/` when implemented.

## MiroThinker research integration + anti-crawl MCP (future items — research-backed, live-tested 2026-06-12/13)

Research (MiroResearchImpler, **live-tested with the user's MiroMind key**) established the hosted
`mirothinker-1-7-deepresearch` is a **closed server-side agent**: it ignores caller-supplied OpenAI `tools`
(uses its own server-side `web-processing.google_search`), and the only official "subscription + your own tool"
channel — `mcp_servers` — returns `403 mcp_servers_not_allowed` (gated behind a beta this account lacks). Net:
external tooling has exactly one legal entry (`mcp_servers`), currently disabled. MiroFlow ships **no** browsing
MCP on any branch (only a Playwright `browser_session.py`), so an anti-crawl MCP must be user-supplied regardless.
Full detail: `docs/sendbox/toMiroResearchImpler/miromind-repos-and-anticrawl.zh.md`.

1. **MiroResearch as a JarvanKB research skill.** A CLI-wrapper skill over the MiroMind Responses API
   (`MIROMIND_API_KEY`), living in the parent repo `Skills/MiroResearch`. **Soft-linked into JarvanKB at
   `Skill/research/MiroResearch` → `../../../../Skills/MiroResearch`** (new `Skill/research/` category; relative,
   monorepo-portable; done 2026-06-13). Not an MCP; no anti-crawl of its own. **Long-term form decision
   (deferred):** keep symlink / vendor copy / submodule — **must be resolved at the standalone-repo extraction
   (UN-041)**, since the link points OUTSIDE JarvanKB into the parent `Skills/` and breaks on extraction.

2. **Repo MCP façade v1 — crawl/anti-crawl tools first (no-dependency — start anytime).** Framed (user
   2026-06-14) as the **first slice of a repo-wide MCP façade**, NOT a one-off: a thin aggregator that
   re-exposes existing capability as MCP tools, built to grow tool-modules (one per engine/skill) toward "one
   MCP = the agent toolbox" — NOT a god-process that absorbs logic (keep Engine/Service/Skill as the
   implementation; MCP = the 4th surface). v1 wraps the crawl path (zhihu-crawl / bilibili-crawl + engines) with
   structured output (content, source_url, fetch_method, auth_context, failure_reason, needs_human_action). One
   MCP serves BOTH downstream paths (item 3), so it does **not** depend on the MiroMind beta reply — the
   no-regret first move. **Placement = new `Service/mcp/` subcategory** (user decision 2026-06-14: option 2 —
   group MCP servers under their own `Service/` subcat; it IS a long-running server like cookie-manager, so it
   lives under Service, wrapping Engine + Skill/crawl as libs). **Granularity rule:** Engine `fetch`/`transcribe`
   + Skill/crawl → request/response tools; **Services/watchers = daemons → only *control* tools (status/once),
   the daemon stays a Service**. **Compliance boundary baked in:** authorized sessions/cookies only, rate-limit +
   cache + provenance, manual handoff on CAPTCHA/access walls — NO CAPTCHA bypass / access-control evasion /
   identity rotation. **Consumption rule of thumb (2026-06-14):** stateful/shared-backend capability (crawl +
   anti-crawl: cookies, rate-limit, cache) → expose + consume as **MCP** (one central backend, all runtimes incl.
   Hermes); pure-instruction / agent-local capability (research prompts, grill-with-docs, classify heuristics) →
   stays a **Skill**. Don't double-front the same capability (once crawl is MCP, don't also sync the crawl Skill
   to Hermes).

3. **Pending user decision — Path A vs Path C** (surfaced to user 2026-06-13; tracked Dashboard UN-042; the
   `mcp_servers` beta request was already sent to MiroMind, awaiting reply):
   - **(A) Subscription path** — once MiroMind grants the `mcp_servers` beta, attach the item-2 MCP to the hosted
     mirothinker. Lightest ops, uses the subscription; blocked until beta granted; MCP must be publicly reachable.
   - **(C) Self-host now** — MiroFlow + a third-party brain (Claude/GPT/Gemini) + the item-2 MCP. Works today,
     full local control; does **not** consume the MiroMind subscription.
   - Path B (MiroFlow + hosted mirothinker as brain) is **eliminated** by the evidence. Decision = wait for
     Miro's reply, then branch; item-2 is the no-regret first move under both.

**UPDATE 2026-06-15 — MiroMind replied (reopens the option space):** (a) they will **enable the `mcp_servers`
beta** on the account (Path A unblocked); (b) **a non-`-h` model supports client-side tool calls** (honors
OpenAI `tools` → emits `tool_calls` for our client to execute) — unlike the `-h`/deepresearch model that runs
its own server-side search and ignores caller tools. Consequences:
   - **New Path A′** = non-`-h` model + client-side tools: uses the subscription, no beta needed, our anti-crawl
     tools run locally; cost = we drive the agent loop (no Miro deepresearch harness).
   - **Path B may REVIVE**: the report's 方案 B death-sentence was specifically the deepresearch model ignoring
     client-side tools. If the non-`-h` model honors them, self-hosted **MiroFlow + non-`-h` API as brain +
     local anti-crawl MCP** becomes viable AND subscription-using — exactly the "self-host harness + official
     API" combination. **Unconfirmed — pending the follow-up to Miro** (below).
   - **Follow-up questions sent to Miro** (UN-042): ① does the API serve a *pure tool-calling model* or the
     *full server-side deepresearch harness* — and which model id is the non-`-h` one? ② if we self-host
     MiroFlow/MiroThinker and point its brain at the non-`-h` API, do `tools`/`tool_calls` work end-to-end so
     our locally-attached anti-crawl MCP fires (= 方案 B revived)? ③ does API-as-brain-of-self-hosted-harness
     bill against the subscription normally?
   - **Item-2 design implication:** build the `Service/mcp/` crawl façade so the **same crawl logic both
     exposes an MCP server AND exports OpenAI tool-schemas** → covers A (MCP attach), A′ (client-side tools),
     and a revived B with one capability. (B′ = local open-source weights stays the no-subscription/GPU fallback.)

**RESOLVED 2026-06-15 — Miro answered in detail (corrects the UPDATE above):** Models = `apodex-1-0-deepresearch-h`
(multi-agent; **no mcp/client-tc** — tool-call protocols assume one pausable loop, a multi-agent orchestrator has
no single caller-facing pause point + hardest external-tool routing), `apodex-1-0-deepresearch` (non-`-h` workflow),
`-mini`. (Naming mismatch vs docs' `mirothinker-1-7-*` — confirm exact id.) **Key: the platform offers NO bare-model
API** → the floated **Path A′ (subscription pure-model + client-side tools) does NOT exist via the API**; client-side
tool-call is only via **self-hosted open weights (B′, GPU, no subscription)**. **`mcp_servers` confirmed = server-side
remote MCP** (you host a public endpoint, request carries `mcp_servers:[{name,url,access_token,...}]`, Miro's server
calls it; supports `tool`+`resource`; **no URL whitelist during beta**). The hosted non-`-h` workflow supports
tool-call via `mcp_servers` **with a user whitelist**. **→ Path A (hosted non-`-h` workflow + `mcp_servers`) is the
only subscription-using, officially-supported route; B′ is the only client-side/local-tools route.**

**DECISION 2026-06-15 — user CHOSE Path A.** Non-A paths (B dead / B′ self-host weights / C third-party brain)
summarized + archived as a fallback reference (use only if Path A breaks — Miro revokes beta / mcp tools don't
fire / public exposure unacceptable): **`docs/sendbox/archive/mirothinker-fallback-paths.md`** (the single
pointer). **MCP auth/security design for the impler:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-mcp-facade-auth-security-design.md`
(binding contract — capability minimization, cookie-never-crosses-interface, strong per-request auth,
Nginx+TLS+IP-allowlist, domain-allowlist+rate-limit+audit). AntiCrawlMcpImpler (UN-043) consumes that spec; not
yet dispatched (the 6 Miro confirmations below are wanted early).
   - **🔴 Item-2 HARD CONSTRAINT:** because the MCP must be **public** with **no Miro-side URL whitelist**, and it
     uses the user's authorized cookies, the `Service/mcp/` façade MUST: (1) **never accept/return cookies** (pulled
     in-memory from localhost cookie-manager, used only outbound, never echoed); (2) expose **only URL→markdown**,
     no raw-cookie / arbitrary-request / proxy tool (capability minimization → a leaked token can't get the cookie or
     hit arbitrary sites); (3) **strong per-request auth** (bearer/OAuth over HTTPS, rotatable) since no URL whitelist;
     (4) sit behind Nginx+TLS (reuse the cookie-manager frp pattern) + optional **IP-allowlist Miro's egress** on our
     side; (5) **domain-allowlist** zhihu.com/bilibili.com + per-token rate-limit + audit log. (B′ avoids all this —
     tools stay local, zero public surface.) User-facing detail: `docs/sendbox/toUser/mirothinker-path-aprime-client-side-explainer.md`.
   - **Open to confirm (UN-042):** exact model id (apodex vs mirothinker); both whitelists enabled for the account;
     does `mcp_servers` tool actually fire (vs internal-search fallback); precise schema (transport http/SSE, auth);
     Miro egress IPs (for our IP-allowlist); B′ GPU/no-subscription acceptable?

## How this doc is updated

Append-most. Major changes (phase scope reshuffle, recipe upgrade, project rename) go through `RepoMem.merge` HITL review.
